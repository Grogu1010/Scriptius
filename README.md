# Scriptius

Scriptius is a focused, offline-first screenwriting workspace that runs entirely in the browser. It keeps your draft, outline and insights side by side so you can stay in flow while the app handles formatting, autosave and sharing for you.

## Key capabilities
- Automatic screenplay formatting with scene, character and transition shortcuts.
- Personal library with autosave, instant search and inline previews of every draft.
- Outline and preview panes that stay in sync with the editor as you work.
- One-click export to Fountain, plain text or a printable layout.
- Secure share links generated locally so collaborators can open the same draft.

## Getting started
Open `index.html` in a modern browser to launch the studio. Your changes stay on this device unless you choose to export or share them.

## Development notes
The app stores data in `localStorage`. If you are working on new features, keep the storage footprint in mind and make sure autosave continues to succeed when storage is unavailable.
